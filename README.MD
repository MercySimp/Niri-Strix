Arch Niri Strix

IN DEV RAMBLINGS 
This is just a pet project that is heavily inspired by omarchy, as omarchy is just a hyprland rice for Arch. So I thought why not do the same for Niri? 
Then came the question of why even ever use this versus any other option? Which comes down to me being gaming.
Every version I find is heavily inclusive of coding and programing apps, I don't really need those for my use case. I want yay, steam, lutris, wine, retroarch etc.
So that is where this came to be as I felt since I like my flavor of Arch maybe someone else might to. 

Strix uses linux-zen as the kernel, limine as the bootloader, btrfs for file structure, and the skew of packages listed in the package file. There are also some other hard coded values but they might become variables in later versions.

The first step was replication, build an ISO, then to build an install script which I felt would be easiest by passing a json file to archinstall. So that is what is currently being worked on, passing a json to archinstall.

This is still under heavily development and I only work on this when not doing my day job so hope to have a functioning version by end of the month but no clue.
